# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added
- **GasFree Support**: Full integration for the GasFree payment scheme on TRON.
- **Transaction Polling**: Facilitator now supports asynchronous polling for GasFree transaction status (`SUCCEED`/`FAILED`) with a 3-minute grace period.
- **Dynamic Provider Discovery**: Client SDKs now automatically discover and randomly select from available GasFree service providers.
- **Cross-Language Integration**: Validated interoperability between TypeScript Client and Python Facilitator for GasFree payments.

### Changed
- **Signer Refactor**: Standardized EIP-712 / TIP-712 signers to be **Domain Neutral**.
- **Interface Upgrade**: `sign_typed_data` and `verify_typed_data` now require an explicit `primary_type` argument.
- **Constants Standardized**: Standardized naming for protocol-specific EIP-712 constants (`GASFREE_PRIMARY_TYPE`, `PAYMENT_PERMIT_EIP712_DOMAIN_TYPE`).
- **Improved Logging**: Enhanced facilitator audit logs and resource usage tracking.

### Fixed
- Fixed EIP-712 Domain compatibility for protocols requiring the `version` field (like GasFree).
- Fixed Pydantic field naming consistency in response models.
- Fixed `web3.py` dependency handling in EVM signers for environments where it's optional.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed
- tronpy client now supports TronGrid API key via `TRON_GRID_API_KEY`

## [0.1.5] - 2026-02-05

### Added
- Multi-network facilitator support (Nile and Mainnet simultaneously)
- Async transaction verification with AsyncTron client

### Changed
- Updated PaymentPermit contract addresses:
  - Mainnet: `THnW1E6yQWgx9P3QtSqWw2t3qGwH35jARg`
  - Shasta: `TVjYLoXatyMkemxzeB9M8ZE3uGttR9QZJ8`
  - Nile: `TQr1nSWDLWgmJ3tkbFZANnaFcB5ci7Hvxa`
- Server automatically fetches facilitator address from `/supported` endpoint
- Removed `max_amount` filter from `PaymentRequirementsFilter`
- All tronpy operations converted to AsyncTron with proper async/await
- Simplified transaction verification to status check only (60s timeout)

### Fixed
- Fixed on-chain transaction failure: `permit.caller` now matches facilitator address
- Fixed contract ABI to match new PaymentPermit deployment
- Fixed all linting and formatting issues
- Fixed test imports to use new mechanism names
